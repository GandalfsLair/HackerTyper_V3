LRPHackerTyper V3 A generic HackerTyper program

** What is it? **

A program that allows the user to hit the keyboard however instead of the specific keys that are pressed appearing on the screen, the contents of a text file (code.txt) are printed to screen instead. 
The user just needs to mash the keys and th contents appear without any errors.

Added into this are a set of Hot Keys. Hitting these 3 (three) times in a row will trigger a pop up message box. 
These hot keys can be found on 'Keyboard Shortcuts.txt' Hitting escape will clear the pop ups.

** Amending the Code ** 
I have tried to make it clear how to add to this code. 
See the comments within the 'Script.js' file for details. Any problems please contact me.

** Changes from Version 2 ** 
This version differs from Version 1 in the following ways:
1. Pressing ENTER / Return on the keyboard causes the content of 'code.txt' to be automatically displayed on screen, scrolling downwards.
2. Hotkeys are assigned to keys 1 to 0 on the main keyboard.
3. Hotkeys only need tobe pressed once.
4. Escape clears pop ups.


** Legally Bits ** 
This is not my strong point. I am likely to mess this up. 
My intention is to release this so that you can take it, use it, copy it, amend it, and improve on it. 
If you do improve on it, please let me know!!
